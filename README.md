    Use your energy to do work, don't just create <i>Friction</i>.

Find yourself on Instagram Reels all day? Can't escape the Twitter drug? We'll help you break that habit with a bit of social friction.

Here's how it works:

* Get all your friends together in a group.
  * You can set your group's timezone as well as a designated no-fricition rest period.
* Anytime someone scrolls on a website like Twitter or Instagram, the distance they scrolled is tracked.
* The more distance that the group scrolls, the more "friction" is added to everyone's trackpad.
  * This means over time, if people are doomscrolling a lot, it becomes harder & harder to scroll....

That way you put your energy towards other things, not just creating friction.
